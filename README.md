Create a simple app using Obj-C that should do the following:
Make a request to: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/photos
Display thumbnail versions of the images in the returned JSON. Images should be loaded asynchronously. Do not use any third party libraries.
If a thumbnail is tapped it should switch to another view to show the full size image.
Cache all of the images locally based on their ID.â€¨
